= amazon-webservices

This tiny demo shows the mavenization of running the Java SDK standard tool _wsimport_
to import a WSDL and generate a consumable JAR file with all the generated "portable
artifacts" for client.

The WSDL happens to be for Amazon's older web service but any WSDL should do,
just so you change the generated package name at the same time as you change the WSDL.

Part of a larger project to use Amazon's services, which is not publicly released, sorry.

== Usage

Just do:

	mvn jaxws:wsimport package
