= amazon-webservices

This tiny demo shows the mavenization of running _wsimport_ to import a WSDL
and generate a consumable JAR file with all the generated "portable
artifacts" for client.

It's also a good demo of a relatively-simple "Maven 102" project.

In days of yore, `wsimport` was a command-line tool included in the Java SE
SDK because, well, people would, you know, need to generate files from WSDL.
Earlier versions of this project used the Java `exec` plugin to run
`wsimport`.  Around Java 9, `wsimport` abruptly disappeared from the SDK.
Fortunately, some kind souls
created a Maven plugin that works, presumably running the same Java code
that was used by the `wsimport` command-line tool.  That plugin is now used
herein.

The WSDL happens to be for Amazon's older web service, but any WSDL should
do, just so you change the generated package name at the same time as you
change the WSDL.

Part of a larger project to use Amazon's services, which is not publicly
released.
